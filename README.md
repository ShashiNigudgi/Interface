Interface Concepts in OOP (Library Management Example)

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with a focus on interfaces. 
The implementation showcases how interfaces can be used to define contracts for different classes, 
ensuring a consistent structure and behavior across multiple implementations.

Overview

The project implements a system where the IDatabase interface defines a contract for database-related operations. 
Classes like OracleSql, PostgresSql, and Operating_system implement this interface, and the program demonstrates their usage through the Application class.
